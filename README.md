<h2> Description </h2>

This is a project specified by WGU to solve a package delivery routing problem, which is essentially the traveling salesman problem with a dedicated starting node and a few restrictions/requirements. For my solution, I implemented the nearest neighbor algorithm which operates with a time-complexity of O(n).

## Usage

To get the code run this from the command line:

```commandline
https://github.com/Toyontewo/MiniBankingSystem.git
```

Once that is done, in the main directory where `main.py` is located run:

```commandline
python3 main.py
```

depending on python version^^^
